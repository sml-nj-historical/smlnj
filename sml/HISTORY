This is the HISTORY file for the Yale SML/NJ CVS repository.

An entry should be made for _every_ commit to the repository.
The entries in this file will be used when creating the README
for new versions, so keep that in mind when writing the
description.

The form of an entry should be:

Tag: leunga-20000310-fix_x86_asm_ra
Description:

More assembly output problems involving the indexed addressing mode
on the x86 have been found and corrected. Thanks to Fermin Reig for the
fix.

The interface and implementation of the register allocator have been changed
slightly to accommodate the possibility to skip the register allocation 
phases completely and go directly to memory allocation.  This is needed
for C-- use.

Tag: blume_main_v110p26p1_0
Description:

* Complete re-organization of library names.  Many libraries have been
consolidated so that they share the same path anchor.  For example,
all MLRISC-related libraries are anchored at MLRISC, most libraries that
are SML/NJ-specific are under "smlnj".  Notice that names like
host-cmb.cm or host-compiler.cm no longer exist.  See system/README
for a complete description of the new naming scheme.  Quick reference:

   host-cmb.cm        -> smlnj/cmb.cm
   host-compiler.cm   -> smlnj/compiler.cm
   full-cm.cm         -> smlnj/cm.cm
   <arch>-<os>.cm     -> smlnj/cmb/<arch>-<os>.cm
   <arch>-compiler.cm -> smlnj/compiler/<arch>.cm

* Bug fixes in CM.
    - exceptions in user code are being passed through (i.e., reach top level)
    - more bugs in paranoia mode fixed
    - bug related to checking group owners fixed

* New install.sh script that automagically fetches archive files:
  The new file config/srcarchiveurl must contain the URL of the
  (remote) directory that contains bin files (or other source archives).
  If install.sh does not find the archive locally, it tries to get
  it from that remote directory.
  This should simplify installation further:  For machines that have
  access to the internet, just fetch <version>-config.tgz, unpack it,
  edit config/targets, and go (run config/install.sh).  The scipt will
  fetch everything else that it might need all by itself.

  For CVS users, this mechanism is not relevant for source archives, but
  it is convenient for getting new sets of binfiles.

  Archives should be tar files compressed with either gzip, compress, or
  bzip2.  The script recognizes .tgz, .tar, tar.gz, tz, .tar.Z, and .tar.bz2.

Tag: blume_main_v110_26_2
Description:
- size info in BOOTLIST
     * no fixed upper limits for number of bootfiles or length of
       bootfile names in runtime
     * falling back to old behavior if no BOOTLIST size info found
- allocation size heuristics in .run-sml
     * tries to read cache size from /proc/cpuinfo (this is important for
        small-cache Celeron systems!)
- install.sh robustified
- CM manual updates
- paranoid mode
     * no more CMB.deliver() (i.e., all done by CMB.make())
     * can re-use existing sml.boot.* files
     * init.cmi now treated as library
     * library stamps for consistency checks
- sml.boot.<arch>-<os>/PIDMAP file
     * This file is read by the CM startup code.  This is used to minimize
       the amount of dynamic state that needs to be stowed away for the
       purpose of sharing between interactive system and user code.
- CM.Anchor.anchor instead of CM.Anchor.{set,cancel}
     * Upon request by Elsa.  Anchors now controlled by get-set-pair
       like most other CM state variables.
- Compiler.CMSA eliminated
     * No longer supported by CM anyway.
- fixed bugs in pickler that kept biting Stefan
     * past refs to past refs (was caused by the possibility that
       ad-hoc sharing is more discriminating than hash-cons sharing)
     * integer overflow on LargeInt.minInt
- ml-{lex,yacc} build scripts now use new mechanism
  for building standalone programs
- fixed several gcc -Wall warnings that were caused by missing header
  files, missing initializations, etc., in runtime (not all warnings
  eliminated, though)
