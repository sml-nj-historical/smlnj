	(sml-def-skeleton): Nop if skeletons aren't available.
	(skeletons): Use `> _' and `@'.
	(sml-forms-menu): Don't bother with easy-menu-filter-return crap.
	(sml-cm-mode-syntax-table, sml-cm-font-lock-keywords): New vars.
	(sml-cm-mode): Use define-derived-mode rather than define-generic-mode.
	(sml-lex-font-lock-keywords, sml-lex-font-lock-defaults): New vars.
	(sml-yacc-font-lock-keywords): Use sml-lex-font-lock-keywords.
	Refine pattern to recognize the %prec keyword.

2000-10-06  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-mode.el: Make the toplevel closer to usual practice.
	(sml-imenu-regexp, sml-imenu-create-index): New var and fun.
	(sml-mode): Use them.
	(sml-beginning-of-defun): Add `and' as function-leader.
	(sml-lex-mode): New trivial mode.
	(sml-yacc-bnf-face, sml-yacc-indent-action, sml-yacc-indent-pipe) 
	(sml-yacc-indent-term, sml-yacc-font-lock-keywords) 
	(sml-yacc-font-lock-defaults): New vars.

2000-08-24  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-proc.el (inferior-sml-mode-map): Don't inherit from sml-bindings.
	Add the binding for C-c C-l explicitly instead.
	(sml-run): Look in cwd (but only if the command has slashes).

	* sml-mode.el (sml-mode-abbrev-table): Remove (created by
	define-derived-mode).
	(sml-mode): Setup add-log's current-defun-function.

	(sml-indent-default): Use symbol membership rather than a regexp.
	Also, use `sym-indent' instead of (current-column).
	This fixes a problem with a hanging `structure Foo = (struct|let)'
	(due to `structure' having a sml-indent-rule, as opposed to `fun').
	Hopefully it won't introduce other problems.
	(sml-font-lock-keywords): Match vars `val x : int' also.
	(sml-electric-pipe): Update to the new `sml-find-matching-starter' and
	return a sensible default instead of raising an error in case of

	compilation-minor-mode's keybindings.
	(run-sml): Turn into an alias for sml-run.
	(sml-run): Query the user for the command.  If prefix is set (or if
	default value is not null) query for args and host.
	Use `split-string' rather than our own function.
	Run cmd on another host if requested and pass it an init file.
	Pop to the buffer at the end.
	(sml-args-to-list): Remove.
	(sml-compile): Look for special files (sml-compile-command-alist) in
	the current dir (and its parents) to choose a default command.
	Remember the command for next time in the same buffer.
	Make the `cd' explicit in the command so the user can change it.
	(sml-make-error): Fix for when `endline' is absent.

	* sml-mode.el: Pass it through checkdoc.
	(sml-mode-version): Remove.
	(sml-load-hook): Remove.
	(sml-mode-info): Use `info' rather than `Info-goto-node'.
	(sml-keywords-regexp): Add "o".
	(sml-syntax-prop-table): Use `defsyntax'.
	(sml-font-lock-syntactic-keywords): Only use nested comments if supported.
	(sml-mode): Use `define-derived-mode'.
	(sml-electric-pipe): `sml-indent-line' -> `indent-according-to-mode'.
	(sml-indent-line): Use `indent-line-to'.
	(sml-cm-mode): New mode for CM files.

	* Makefile: Update.

	* sml-mode-startup.el: Remove since it's now autogenerated.

	* sml-defs.el (sml-bindings): Remove left over C-c` binding.
