* improve M-C-f and M-C-b (they too often don't do the right thing) and
  add M-C-k and other such sexp-chunked operations.

* if indentation is non-obvious, return a list of possible indentations
  and choose the first unless the current is one of the possible choices.

* make `M-x sml-compile' more generic.

* allow specifying indentation of dependent keywords (how to indent `in'
  relative to `let', for example).

* use symbols instead of strings for `sym'.

* ignore warnings in C-x ` ????

* recognize irrefutable patterns (with "Capital"-heuristics, for example:
  a regexp like "\\([(),]\\|[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*\\)+").
  This can then be used to allow indenting like

		(fn x =>
		 some expressions)

* take advantage of text after-the-line (when available) for indentation.

* obey fixity directives.

* right-align "and" with its correspondent.
