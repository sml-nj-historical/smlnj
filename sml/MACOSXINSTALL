Installation instructions for SML/NJ under MacOS X
--------------------------------------------------

To install SML/NJ under MacOS X on a machine that has the developer
tools installed (i.e., which has a working C compiler), refer to
our generic instructions in file INSTALL.

For people without developer tools on their MacOS X box we prepared
a disk image that contains a pre-compiled runtime system.  To install,
download the image, mount it, and copy its contents (a directory named
smlnj-xxx.xxx) to some location of your choice.  (The name smlnj-xxx.xxx
is not important -- you can change it or simply copy the contents of
this directory into some other directory.)

At this point you should have some directory, e.g., /Users/joe/smlnj,
that contains two subdirectories named "config" and "bin".  Open a
terminal (or xterm if you have X11), cd to /Users/joe/smlnj
and follow the instructions in file INSTALL beginning *after* the
point where it asks you to gunzip and untar config.tgz.

For example, if you are in a hurry and have good network connectivity,
simply edit config/targets and then run config/new-install.sh (or
config/install.sh).

Once the installer finishes, you only need to keep the "bin" and "lib"
subdirectories.  You can move them wherever you like (together!) as
long as you set the variable SMLNJ_HOME to the name of the directory
that holds them.
