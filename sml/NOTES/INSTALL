Installation instructions for SML/NJ
------------------------------------

These are instructions for installing recent "working" versions of SML/NJ
on Unix-like systems, including MacOX X with the developer tools installed.

If you are running MacOS X but don't have the developer tools, you can
install the system starting from the disk image that we provide.  See
MACOSXINSTALL for details.

If you are running Win32, see WININSTALL.

1. If you are in a hurry (and you have network connectivity) ...
----------------------------------------------------------------

   - Pick a place to do the installation, e.g.

      $ d=/usr/share/smlnj     # or whatever you like
      $ mkdir $d
      $ cd $d

   - Download config.tgz, e.g.

      $ v=110.81               # or whatever is the version you desire
      $ wget http://smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu/dist/working/$v/config.tgz

   - Gunzip and untar, e.g.

      $ gunzip <config.tgz | tar xf -

     This creates a subdirectory "config"

   - Edit the "config/targets" file to your taste.  If you leave this
     file alone, you end up with a minimal installation.

   - Run the installer, it will automatically fetch all other necessary
     tarballs:

      $ config/install.sh

     If the installer complains about not being able to fetch those
     tarballs, try step 2.1.

2. If you have a bit more time...
---------------------------------

   2.1.  If you do not have network connectivity...
   -------------------------------------------------

   - Use some other means of downloading the necessary tarballs.  Store
     them in directory $d.  Then run the installer (config/install.sh).

     Here is a table that shows which packages you will need to download
     depending on what you select in config/targets.  Take the union of
     all the packages corresponding to your selection.  Don't forget to
     include the "(always)" entry.  (<arch> and <os> should match your
     host system.)

     Keep in mind that making selections in config/targets there are
     dependencies between packages.  For example, eXene requires cml
     and cml-lib.  The installer script "knows" about these dependencies
     and will automatically calculate the transitive closure of the
     "requires" relation for you.  Still, if you do not have network
     connectivity, then you should have downloaded tarballs for the
     entire transitive closure.  (If you didn't, the installer will
     kindly remind you.)

          if you select...         |    ... you need

   2.2.  Tweaking "preloads"...
   ----------------------------

    - Before running the installer (but after unpacking the config
      directory), you can customize the set of libraries that are
      pre-loaded (either directly or via CM's "autoload" mechanism).

      For this, edit config/preloads before running config/install.sh.

   2.3.  Using a different ftp server (for a step-1.-like installation)
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

    - If you have a local mirror for smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu/dist,
      then you can speed up installation by pointing the automatic URL
      fetch mechanism there.  The URL of the repository is stored in
      config/srcarchiveurl.  Edit this file before running
      config/install.sh.

   2.4.  Using locally stored tarballs
   -----------------------------------

    - This is like step 2.3. -- except the URL in config/srcarchiveurl
      should read something like

          file:///usr/src/packages/smlnj/working/110.38

      (In other words, the URL should spell out the name of the local
      directory that happens to contain the tarballs.  Notice that
      this method does not seem to work with certain versions of wget
      which do not understand the file:// scheme.)

   2.5.  What needs to be on my PATH?
   ----------------------------------

   - You should include $d/bin into your PATH.

   2.6.  Which of all those files do I really need?
   ------------------------------------------------

   After the installer completes, directory $d will be full of files
   and subdirectories.  Not all of them are actually required if you want
   to use the system.

   In particular, if you are not interested in any of the source code,
   you can DELETE EVERYTHING EXCEPT:

      $d/bin
      $d/lib

   2.7.  Can I move files to another directory after the fact?
   -----------------------------------------------------------

   Yes.

   Here is the procedure:

   Suppose you have installed everything under $d and now you want to
   move things to some other directory $e (e.g., e=/usr/share/smlnj):

     1. Move (at least) $d/bin and $d/lib to $e:

        $ mv $d/{bin,lib} $e

     2. Before running the "sml" command, set the environment variable
        SMLNJ_HOME to point to $e:

        $ export SMLNJ_HOME=$e

        If you want to put the contents of $e/lib somewhere else, then
        point CM_PATHCONFIG to wherever the path configuration file
        lives.  (The default is $SMLNJ_HOME/lib/pathconfig.)

        You can also scatter around the contents of $e/lib.  If you do so,
        you have to edit the path configuration file itself.  See the CM
        manual for more information on path anchors and path configuration.

   2.8 Forcing the installer to use a particular URL getter program
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

   By default, config/install.sh will attempt to use wget, curl, and
   lynx (in that order).  If you already know which of these programs
   you want the installer to use, then set the environment variable
   URLGETTER to "wget", "curl", or "lynx", respectively.

   You can also set URLGETTER to any other command "foo" as long as
   it can be invoked as

       $ foo <source> <destination>

   where <source> is the URL you want to fetch and <destination> is
   the file name where the result will be stored.

   2.9 Where are those "CM" directories?
   -------------------------------------

   CM metadata (source skeletons, compiled files, stable libraries, GUIDs,
   ...) are now stored under a directory called ".cm".  We changed this
   from the original "CM" because of name clashes on case-insensitive
   file systems.  However, SML/NJ itself can work with any (reasonable)
   choice of name for the metadata directory -- but for consistency the
   choice has to be made at installation time.

   To choose a different name for metadata directories, run
   config/install.sh in the presence of an environment variable
   CM_DIR_ARC.  For example, if you want to have all these directories
   be named "FOOBAR", then run the installer (assuming a Bourne-ish
   shell) as

      $ CM_DIR_ARC=FOOBAR config/install.sh

3. Troubleshooting:
-------------------

   3.1. You think you have network connectivity, but the installer fails
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    - You probably do not have any of the following commands available
      on your system:  wget, lynx, curl.

      Failsafe remedy:  Proceed according to step 2.1., using whatever
      other FTP client you have.

      Alternative remedy:  If you have some other command-line tool to
      fetch URLs, make a wrapper for it (if necessary) so that it can
      be invoked with precisely two arguments: <srcurl> and <dst>.
      Then set the environment variable URLGETTER to the name of this
      (wrapped) tool and try running the installer.

      Example:  Suppose you don't have wget but a wget-lookalike named
      "xget".  You could then make a shell script that wraps xget, e.g.
      using a shell script "myxget" consisting of the single line:

         $ exec xget -nv -O $2 $1

      Once you have myxget, simply run:

         $ URLGETTER=myxget config/install.sh

   3.2. The install fails with a message about 32-bit support
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   SML/NJ is a 32-bit system.  This means that on a 64-bit architecture,
   such as the x86-64, there must be support for running 32-bit binaries.
   On Mac OS X, this is standard, but some 64-bit Linux systems are
   not configured with 32-bit support.  In such a case, you will get
   the message

        !!! SML/NJ requires support for 32-bit executables

   during the install process.  To fix this problem, you will need
   to acquire the 32-bit emulation libraries for your particular Linux
   distribution.

   For Debian (7.0 Wheezy and later) and recent version of Ubuntu, you will
   need to enable multiarch support.  See https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch or
   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec for details, or try the following
   commands:

        dpkg --add-architecture i386
        apt-get update
        apt-get install libc6:i386

   For older versions of Debian and Ubuntu, you will need to install three
   packages using apt-get:

        apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib ia32-libs

   For Red Hat Fedora (at least Fedora 16), you will need to install
   glibc-devel(i686):

        yum install glibc-devel.i686

   For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (or CentOS), you may also have to
   install the rpm package libgcc-multilib, e.g.:

        yum groupinstall "Development tools"
        yum install libgcc.i686
        yum install glibc-devel.i686

   Older instructions for RHEL and CentOS: download the libgcc-multilib package
   from rpmseek.com and then run

        rpm -ivh libgcc-multilib-xxx.x86_64.rpm

   where the libgcc-multilib package is the one you downloaded.

   For openSUSE use the YaST administration tool to install the gcc-32bit
   package.
