MLRISC has been enhanced to support languages such as C and 
<a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~reig/c--.html">C--</a>.
Specific enhancements include:

<ul>
  <li> Integer and floating point operations of various widths have been
included
  <li> Loads and stores of various widths, plus the ability to 
       sign-extend and zero-extend loads have been included
  <li> Conversions between floating point and integer types are included
</ul>   

In addition, C-- also requires the ability to specify unaligned
loads and stores.  These have also been added.
<p>
The new <a href="mltree.html">MLTREE</a> 
language has been extended to allow all these to be specified.
