TransTypes

* primaryEnv should be generalized to an environment that deals with all
the different sources of LT.tcc_fn abstractions.

* which tycons are collected in the freetycs field of datatypes?  Are
  these exactly the volatile primaries that appear in the dataype dcon
  signature?

* what _tycons_ are translated into LT.tcc_var db indexes?

    -- those that have kind FORMAL, and correspondingly appear at some
         level in the current primaryEnv.  This primaryEnv level
	 corresponds to a functor abstraction. (TFN abstractor in
         functor expression translation (FCTfct case of mkFctexp in Translate))

    -- tycons referred to by FREEtyc and RECtyc within a datatype
         representation.  These are translated into local db indices
         refering to abstractions (tcc_fn) that are part of the the
	 same datatype representations. (tcc_fn abstractor)

* what else is translated into LT.tcc_var db indexes?

    -- tyvar with LBOUND(SOME{depth,index,...}) content, in tyToTyc.
         These are inferred, polymorphically abstracted univariables.
         The corresponding abstractor is the FLINT expression
         abstractor TFN.


Volatility and epcontext

* tycon is volatile if it is in the domain of the epcontext (primary or secondary)
* isFree (elabmod.sml) checks if a tycon is in the domain of epContext

* epcontext binds both GENtyc(FORMAL) and DEFtyc and GENtyc(DATATYPE) tycons
     (bindNewTycs in elabmod.sml)
