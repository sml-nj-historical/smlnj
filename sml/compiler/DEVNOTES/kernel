Notation:

tenv closure:
  TC_ENV(tyc,ol,nl,tenv)
    - tyc : the hashed tyc that is being closed
    - ol : int -- number of bindings in tenv = length of tenv
    - nl : int -- 
           (a) number of lambda bindings between original beta-redex
           and current site of the closure (roughly the number of
           lambda bindings the closure has been pushed through by
	   rule (r10).
    - tenv : tycEnv -- tyc env mapping deBruijn indexes to teBinders

teBinder:
  Beta(j,args,ks)
    - j: int -- lambda nesting level of the beta-redex (relative to
           original beta-redex site)
    - args : tyc list -- the redex arguments
    - ks : tkind list -- the kinds of the redex arguments
  Lamb(j,ks)
    - j: int -- lambda nesting level of a "promoted" lambda binding
    - ks: tkind list -- kinds of the lambda-bound variables


Rules for tyc normalization

Beta reduction:

(r1) TC_APP(TC_FN(ks,tyc),tycs) =>             (beta reduction)
       TC_ENV(tyc,1,0,Beta(0,tycs,ks)::nil)

Simplification rules:

(r2) TC_ENV(tyc,0,0,nil) => tyc                (null env)

(r3) TC_ENV(tyc,ol,nl,tcenv) => tyc  (if tyc closed)


Variable lookup:

(r4) TC_ENV((n,k),ol,nl,tcenv) => (n-ol+nl,k)  if n > ol  (adjust free var)

(r5) TC_ENV((n,k),ol,nl,tcenv) => (nl-nl',k)  where tcenv[n] = Lamb(nl',ks)

(r6) TC_ENV((n,k),ol,nl,tcenv) => TC_ENV(tycs[k],0,nl-nl',nil)
     where tcenv[n] = Beta(nl',tycs,ks)

Constructors

(r7) TC_ENV(tyc as TC_PRIM _,ol,nl,tcenv) = tyc   (special case of (r3))

Distribution (generalization of rules r8, r9)

(r8a) TC_ENV(TC_* tyc,ol,nl,tcenv) = 
       TC_* (TC_ENV(tyc,ol,nl,tcenv))

     where TC_* ranges over unary constructors, preserving non-tyc args

(r8b) TC_ENV(TC_* tycs,ol,nl,tcenv) = 
       TC_*(map (fn tyc => TC_ENV(tyc,ol,nl,tcenv)) tycs)

     where TC_* ranges over n-ary constructors: TC_APP, TC_ARROW, TC_SEQ,
     TC_SUM, etc.
     
(r10) TC_ENV(TC_FN(ks,tyc),ol,nl,tcenv) => 
        TC_FN(ks, TC_ENV(tyc,ol+1,nl+1,Lamb(nl,ks)))


Pushing through lambda

(r11) TC_ENV(TC_ENV(tyc,ol,nl,tcenv),0,nl',nil) =>
        TC(tyc,ol,nl+nl',tcenv)


Closure reuse

(r12) TC_APP(TC_FN(ks,TC_ENV(tyc1,ol,nl,Lamb(nl-1,ks))), tycs2) =>
        TC_ENV(tyc1,ol,nl-1,Beta(nl-1,tycs2,ks)::tcenv)


-----------------
Assumptions: 

1. reductions are performed top-down. This means that (r1) is never
applied within the body of a closure, or in other words, (r1) is always
applied at an outermost redex (where TC_ENV closures count as redexes).

2. In TC_ENV(tyc,ol,nl,tcenv), nl is a count of the (nonreduced)
lambda abstractions between the original site of tyc and the
current location of the closure. It can never be negative. 

(a) nl is set to 0 by rule (r1), when a fresh closure is created.
(b) nl is incremented at (r10) when a closure is pushed through a lambda.
(c) nl not decreased by (r11), where two nl values are added.
(d) nl is reduced by subtraction of nl' in rule (r6). We assume
the invariant that nl >= nl' in this rule, so the new nl value
will be non-negative.

3. Closure configurations of the form TC_ENV(tyc,0,nl,nil) can
result from (r6). In such configurations, the nl value is used
to adjust free variables as in rules (r4) and (r5). The (r6) 
variable lookup has moved a moved a tyc into a new context nested
within nl additional lambdas relative to its original site.


-----------------
Invariants:

0. deBruijn indexes start at 1

0a. in (r5), nl > nl'

1. ol and nl are non-negative

	ol >= 0, nl >= 0

1a. in (r6), nl >= nl'


2. ol is the length of the environment

	ol = |tenv|

3. ol = nl =>  ???
