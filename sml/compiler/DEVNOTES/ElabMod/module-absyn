Structures

1. Basic (elabStr) (L643)

A basic structure expression

  struct <decls> end 

is translated into a structure _declaration_:

  structure tempStrId = let <decls> in structure<locations> end

where <locations> is a list of bindings returned by extractSig (L657)
applied to the elaborated body decls. The data structure is:

  STRdec [
     STRB{name = tempStrId,
          def = LETstr(absDecl,STRstr(locations)),
	  str = resStr}
  ]

where
 
  absDecl is abstract syntax of body declaration (elabDecl0, L650)
  resStr = STR{sign,rlzn,access,prim} (L669)

where sign and rlzn are constructed from results of extractSig, and
access is a fresh lvar (L684).

The <locations> bindings are the bindings for the identifiers declared
in <decls> that are exported as components of the structure. The only
relevant information in the bindings for translation are the access
fields (for variables, exception constrs, structures and functors).
Type components are not represented in <locations>.  So it mignt be
possible to strip <locations> down to a list of lvars.

The main translation info in the resStr STR is the access.  This
access info probably should be a direct element of the STRB data
structure.  Then the STR would be only a "type" description (sign and
rlzn) for the structure.  This would make structure declarations more
analagous to value variables, where a VALvar contains an access and
a type as separate properties.
