mkVBs

  case: val x = x (simple variable to variable binding)
    Question: to do explice type abstraction wrapping (mkPE) or not.
      - avoid type eta-expansion?
      - inst param tyvars are always going to equal VB boundtvs?
      - avoid using mkVar if exp is primop var, since mkVar looses
        primop


mkExp
  calls mkVE for variable expression

mkPE 
  Wraps an expression with a type abstraction corresponding to
  the boundtvs of a VB


mkVar
  Translates a VALvar into default dynamic access path via mkAccInfo.
  prim property is discarded.


mkVE(e = VALvar, ts = inst types, d=depth)
  Translate variable that might be bound to a primop.

  Prim case:
    (1) determines the type instantiation parameters relative
    to the primop intrinsice type (intrinsicParams).
    (2) case on primop: performs special immediate translations
    of certain primops, supplying instantiation types: [POLYEQ,
    POLYNEQ, INLMKARRAY, RAW_CCALL).
    For all other primops, calls transPrim with primop, translated
    intrinsic type, and translated intrinsic params.

  Nonprim case:
    calls mkVar if there are no instantiation
    parameters, otherwise calls mkVar and wraps result with appropriate
    TAPP (type application) to translated instantiation types.
 

Control Flow

For simple variable bindings like 

    val x = y

    VB{pat=VARpat(V.VALvar{access=DA.LVAR v, ...}),  (* x *)
       exp as VARexp _, boundtvs=btvs, ...},         (* y *)

The flow is:

    mkVBs --> mkPE --> mkExp -> mkVE

mkPE wraps the rhs variable expression in an n-ary TFN abstraction,
where n = length(btvs), the polymorphically bound tyvars.

mkVE takes care of calculating the type instantiation parameters for
primops relative to their intrinsic types.


========================================

RepTycProps

In order to translate functors into FLINT type abstractions, the
compiler needs to identify the primary type components that 
need to be translated into PLambda types. 

Tycpaths encode the higher-order kind information for the 
primary type components of functors. This information is 
transmitted throughout Translate by a flextycmap which is 
a map from stamps to tycpaths. 

Translate currently uses this functionality in three places. 
1. TransTypes uses RepTycProps.getTk to compute primary type 
component information which in turn is used to obtain 
PLambda kinds in TransTypes.fctRlznLty.
2. In Translate.mkStrexp we compute tycpaths for the arguments 
in an APPstr. These tycpaths can be translated into PLambda types tycs
for the PLambda/FLINT-level type application APP(TAPP(e1, tycs), e2).
3. In Translate.mkFctexp we compute tycpaths for the primary 
formal parameters in the FCTfct case in order to obtain the kinds knds
for use in the PLambda/FLINT-level type abstraction: 
TFN(knds, FN(v, ...))
