# targets
#
# the following is a list of the targets (in addition to sml) that
# this shell script can install.  Comment out those that you do not
# want.  Note that ml-burg requires the smlnj-lib target, and that cml-lib
# requires cml.
#

# build the basic sml compiler
TARGETS="sml"

# unpack the source code for the SML/NJ compiler; this is not required,
# unless you are doing compiler hacking, but it may be interesting to look at.
#
#TARGETS="$TARGETS src-smlnj"

# 
# build the sml compiler with all compiler modules visible at top-level
#
#TARGETS="$TARGETS sml-full"

# build the sml compiler with CM pre-loaded; this is required for using
# any of the libraries.
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS sml-cm"

# Set this flag to TRUE, if you want to have both sml and sml-cm available.
# Otherwise, the sml heap images will be replaced by links to the corresponding
# sml-cm heap images.
#
#INSTALL_SML_AND_CM="TRUE"

# build the testbed compiler; useful for compiler-development work
#
#TARGETS="$TARGETS sml-full-cm"

# build ML-Yacc
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS ml-yacc"

# pre-compile and install the ML-Yacc Library; this is necessary to use
# parsers produced by ML-Yacc
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS ml-yacc-lib"

# build ML-Lex
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS ml-lex"

# pre-compile and install the SML/NJ Library.  Note that this must come
# after ml-lex and ml-yacc, but before ml-burg.
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS smlnj-lib"

# build ML-Burg
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS ml-burg"

# pre-compile and install Concurrent ML, which is a library for message-passing
# concurrency.
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS cml"

# pre-compile and install the CML Library, which provides some useful CML
# modules.
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS cml-lib"

# pre-compile and install eXene, which is a library for X-Windows programming.
# EXene requires CML.
#
TARGETS="$TARGETS eXene"

# unpack and install the documentation directory.
#
#TARGETS="$TARGETS doc"

# If this flag is set to TRUE, then autoloading is enabled in CM.
#
ENABLE_AUTOLOADING=TRUE

# build a version of sml-cm with CML autoloading available.  This
# is called cml-cm.  Eventually, this will evolve into a proper
# interactive version of CML.
#
#TARGETS="$TARGETS cml-cm"

# These flags control which libraries sml-cm will autoload.
#
AUTOLOAD_SMLNJ_LIB=TRUE		# lib/smlnj-lib.cm
AUTOLOAD_SMLNJ_UNIX=TRUE	# lib/unix-lib.cm
#AUTOLOAD_SMLNJ_HTML=TRUE	# lib/html-lib.cm
#AUTOLOAD_SMLNJ_REACTIVE=TRUE	# lib/reactive-lib.cm

# These flags control which libraries cml-cm will autoload.
#
AUTOLOAD_CML_LIB=TRUE		# lib/cml-lib.cm
#AUTOLOAD_EXENE=TRUE		# lib/eXene.cm
